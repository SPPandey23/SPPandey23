## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, driven by curiosity and a strong bias toward execution. I enjoy working at the intersection of **data, algorithms, and real-world impact**.

My core strength lies in **foundational ML concepts**, hands-on experimentation, and building end-to-end AI solutions — from raw data to deployable applications. I believe AI is not just about models, but about **systems, pipelines, and decisions at scale**.

💡 *Currently focused on next-gen AI: Generative AI, RAG pipelines, and Agentic AI systems.*
